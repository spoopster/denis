    <description>[b]This mod requires REPENTOGON, it will not function properly without it![/b]

Say hello to [u]Denis[/u] (and his offspring)!

[h2]Denis' Mechanics[/h2]

Denis can't fire tears and must instead rely on his horde of Minisaacs to attack for him.
- He can charge up to mitose a new Minisaac, and can have more Minisaacs the higher his firerate is.
- His Minisaacs copy tear effects, and certain Minisaacs are guaranteed to fire some tear effects.
- He can pick up and throw Minisaacs by pressing the [DROP] key near them.

The mod contains 11 unlocks for Denis, and full compatibility with the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=836319872]EID[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3404171769]Accurate Blurbs[/url] mods!
